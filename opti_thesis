# Forest Management and NDVI Recovery

## Overview
This project analyzes how expanding an agricultural conservation program (CRP) to include lumber could reduce per-acre government costs while extending environmental benefits.

## Data
- FIA forest inventory data
- NOAA NDVI
- County-year panel data (controls and stumpage)

## Approach
- Panel regression with county and year fixed effects
- Treatment timing and years-since-cut variables
- Optimization based on complex decision variables and parameter interactions

## Key Findings
- Additional plots from New England could be added with little change in overall program costs
- NDVI recovery has the possibility of being large and statistically significant, especially when applied to other areas of the country

## Tools
R, Python, Gurobi
